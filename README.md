# FavColors

A smart color collection tool by Vadim Hermann

---

## What is FavColors?
A little helper tool for Webdesigners. It visualize, group and sort your favourite colors and helps you to pick them quicker up.


## How it works?
**1)** Download and unzip the package.zip

**2)** Add your favourite colors by modifying the content of the `index.html` file

- Set the `data-title` attribute for a title

- Add hex color codes seperated by space

> **HINT**: Colors sorted by their contrasts. If you need a sorting by colors, please create groups.

*Example* 
```html
<div data-title="red">#FD6D52 #E9573E</div>
````

**3)** Upload the unzipped files plus your modified `index.html' file on your server.
