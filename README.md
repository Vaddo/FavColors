## What is FavColors?
It is a little helper tool for Webdesigners, which visualize and organize their favourite colors.


## How it works?
**1)** Download and unzip the package.zip

**2)** Add your favourite colors by modifying the content of the index.html file

> Set the `data-title` attribute for the title

> Add hex color codes seperated by space

*Example* 
```html
<div data-title="red">#FD6D52 #E9573E</div>
````

## And what's special about FavColors?

> FavColors generate groups and create a view of your colors, sorted by their contrasts.
